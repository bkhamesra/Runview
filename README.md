# Runview

Runview is a visualization package designed for numerical relativity simulations. It aims to provide one line solution to completely integrate multiple outputs, analyse the simulation data and present the important results in a series of linked webpages. 

## Runview-v1

This is the current usable version of Runview which is designed primarily for  BBH simulations using GT-Maya code but can easily be adapted to Einstein Toolkit (ET) or ET-based codes. Please consult the wiki for instructions on how to use the package. In case of errors, oddities, or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact the maintainer or use the issue tracker.

## Runview-v2 - Currently In Development.  

This version will aim to extending the scope of Runview from Binary Black holes to any compact object simulations (Stating, Rotating or Boosted Star/Black hole, Binary black holes, Binary Neutron star, Neutron star-Black holes etc). A lot of new functionalities will also be added including checking status of ongoing simulations, construction of gravitational waveform templates for LIGO and performing match calculations
